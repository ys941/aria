"""Generate the Aria demo voiceover by *cloning* a reference voice
with Resemble AI's Chatterbox.

VoiceDesign rolled a fresh voice every call which made the cut jarring.
Cloning anchors timbre to a single reference WAV so every beat lands in
the same voice, every run.

The reference clip at `demo/audio/voice-reference.wav` is 25 s of Bob
Neufeld reading Dostoevsky's *Notes From the Underground* on LibriVox
(public domain) — a slow, dark, weighty male baritone with no music,
ideal for the car-commercial / trailer-narrator vibe.

Outputs `clone-01.wav` … `clone-09.wav` and `clone-full.wav` (0.5 s gaps)
into `demo/audio/`. Run from your project venv:

    python demo/generate-clone.py

To use a different reference, replace `voice-reference.wav` (5–30 s,
clean speech, single speaker, mono works best) and re-run.

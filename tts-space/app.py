"""Aria · Voice Design — Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign on ZeroGPU.

Designs a speaking voice from a natural-language description (gender, age, pitch,
timbre, attitude, pace, accent…). This is the same model the podcast uses locally
(`Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign`), run here via the base `qwen_tts` —
NOT `faster_qwen3_tts`, because that package's CUDA-graph speedup can't survive
ZeroGPU's per-request GPU reclaim. (faster_qwen3_tts → dedicated GPU / Modal.)

Qwen3-TTS has NO emotion/markup tags — expressiveness comes entirely from the
`instruct` description, so write rich, structured voice descriptions.

`import spaces` MUST come before torch so ZeroGPU can patch CUDA.

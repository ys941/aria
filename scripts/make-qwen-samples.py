"""Generate expressive character wavs for the demos using Qwen3-TTS.

Run with the venv that has faster_qwen3_tts + the cached models:
    python scripts/make-qwen-samples.py [duo|groupchat|all] [slug,slug]

Expressiveness in Qwen3-TTS is controlled entirely by the natural-language
`instruct` voice description — it has NO emotion/markup tags (verified in the
package + model config; inline [laughing]/(sighs) would be read literally). So we
write rich, structured descriptions (gender, age, pitch, timbre, attitude, pace,
accent, signature detail) and use expressive sampling params. Each voice is
designed once then cloned per line (Base model) for a consistent timbre, and
every clip is loudness-normalised so the cast sits at an even, polished level.

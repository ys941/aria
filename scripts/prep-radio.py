"""Prep the Reachy FM radio station assets.

Takes the songs dump (mp3 + jpeg album art + srt synced lyrics), slugifies it
into radio/, parses the SRTs into a compact lyrics JSON, and prerecords DJ
Servo's mic breaks with the Qwen3-TTS Modal endpoint (one consistent late-night
FM voice). Idempotent: existing RJ clips are kept unless --re-voice.

Usage:  uv run scripts/prep-radio.py [--src /tmp/songs/songs] [--re-voice]
Needs:  MODAL_TTS_URL / MODAL_TTS_KEY in the environment (or .env), ffmpeg.
